Mason is an open-source, lightweight data access layer for REST resources designed to be used in Java web applications. It handles incoming API requests and routes the parameters to these resources.

### Motivation

Use JSP tags for easily editing queries and request handing. To hot deploy apis without compiling/deploying java classes. Build apis with jsp tags.

### Mason Resources

Mason turns your Plain Old JSPs (with neat tag libraries) into REST Resources. Mason doesn't encourage [using scriptlets in Resource JSPs](http://balusc.omnifaces.org/2010/07/how-to-avoid-java-code-in-jsp-files.html).

You can handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests in your JSP. Mason has been tested with tomcat 9. *jstl.jar* shipped with tomcat is make jstl work.

Learn more about jsp configurations here.

### Mason Tag Libaries

Mason provides a set of tag libraries which you can use in your JSPs.

### Mason Query

You can write database queries inside the resource JSP files or you can place them in `{webAppDir}/WEB-INF/classes/query.properties` file and reference them inside the JSP files. This allows reuse or queries.

#### How does Mason run APIs ?

- Request Processing
- Mapping resource URI to JSP
- Tag libraries to handle HTTP BASIC and JWT Authentication
- Convert SQL Results into JSON/XML based on `Accept` Header ðŸŒŸ
- Make <a href="https://metamug.com/docs/xrequest" target="_blank">External API Requests</a>
- <a href="https://metamug.com/docs/request-parameters#pagination-parameters" target="_blank">Pagination</a>

### Mason Jar

![Mason Jar](http://www.hamptonart.com/image/cache/data/2015WEBPHOTOS/PS0927_MasonJar_BL-500x500.jpg)

Clone and package the project with <a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi" target="_blank">mvn</a>

```
mvn clean package
```
After that you can find *mtg-mason-1.0.jar* inside the target folder. You can use this jar as a dependency in your Java webapp.

### How to use mason in your Webapp

1. Place the mason jar file in `{webAppDir}/WEB-INF/lib` 

2. Download [jstl](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjstl12jar.htm) jar file and place it inside `{webAppDir}/WEB-INF/lib`

3. Create a folder `{webAppDir}/WEB-INF/resources/{resourceVersion}` and place your jsp files here.

4. Import mtg-mason.tld inside your jsp file. This taglib is present inside the mason jar and enables usage of the *mtg* prefix. You will also need to import the jstl taglib. Your jsp file should contain the following
```  
<% @taglib uri="mtg-mason.tld" prefix="mtg" %>
<% @taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>
<% @taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql" prefix="sql" %>
<% @taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" prefix="fmt" %>
```

5. Add the following filter and listener inside `{webAppDir}/WEB-INF/web.xml`
```
<filter>
    <filter-name>RestRouterFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>com.metamug.mason.filters.RestRouterFilter</filter-class>
</filter>

<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>RestRouterFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>

<listener>
    <description>MasonAppContextListener</description>
    <listener-class>com.metamug.mason.listener.AppContextListener</listener-class>
</listener>
```
All requests made to the jsp resources are routed through this filter. 

6. Configure your data source in `{webAppDir}/META-INF/context.xml` file.

You can take a look at the [sample webapp](https://github.com/metamug/mason-sample).

### JDBC Drivers

Except for javaee-web-api since that would be present in your application server and any one out of HSQL, MySQL or PostgreSQL dependency.
We also support Oracle database but due to licensing reason we can't ship oracle jdbc driver along with our MTG SERVER.
So in case you are using Oracle database you'll have to manually install its driver as dependency and use that in this project.
Instructions are given regarding how to do the same in below link(s) (You can refer either of them).

### Data Format Support

Mason supports `application/xml`, `applicaton/json` and `application/json+dataset`
