## mason

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metamug/mason.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metamug/mason) 

Mason is the runtime library used by [Metamug](https://metamug.com) to run APIs. Mason handles incoming API requests and routes the parameters to respective JSP pages.

#### How does Mason run APIs ?

- Request Processing
- Resource Mapping to JSP
- Authentication

> In short, APIs generated by Metamug will not work, if there isn't mason jar in the libs folder.

### Mason Jar
You need to have Apache Maven installed on your system. You can get it . 

Clone and package the project with <a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi" target="_blank">mvn</a>

```
mvn clean package
```

After that you can find *mtg-mason-1.0.jar* inside the target folder. You can use this jar as a dependency in your Java webapp.

You will need to add following line to your jsp for using the *mtg* prefix
```  
<% @taglib uri="mtg-mason.tld" prefix="mtg" %>
```

And also add the following to your *web.xml*
```
<filter>
    <filter-name>RestRouterFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>com.metamug.api.filters.RestRouterFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
```

These steps are generated by metamug in the webapp. You can verify that under the hood by inspecting contents of the war file.
